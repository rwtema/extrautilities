Extra Utilities
==============

Issue tracker

Add bugs as issues and I'll get to them... sometime.




Regarding 1.6.4
==============
As of now, I am no longer developing for 1.6 and any outstanding bugs or issues will NOT be fixed.


Regarding Optifine
==============
I do not support Optifine. Optifine makes a large amount of changes to the way rendering works compared to Forge/Vanilla and I cannot guarantee that these changes will not break things. If you are using Optifnie and are having a problem (especially involving rendering) please check to see if it happens without Optifine enabled before reporting.


Regarding Barrel Liquid Dupe glitch in 1.6.4.
==============
This was fixed in 1.7. See above.


Regarding Missing textures
==============
If you are having a problem with missing textures on large number of blocks and are using Optifine - this is an Optifine bug. Custom texture loading changed in 1.7 and they have not updated their code to reflect this. This is not an Extra Utilities bug. I have heard that new versions will fix this but, to make it clear again, I don't support Optifine.

Regarding Suggestions/Requests
==============
I have always been fairly closed to suggestions, partly because I'm proud and don't like getting help but mostly because I have a lot of ideas I want to implement first. However if you wish to suggest something here, go ahead (make sure it is clearly makred as a suggestion or request) but please do not get offended if I dismiss it summararily.
